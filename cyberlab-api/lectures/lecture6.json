I then want to \nget its content as a string.”\nMoral of the story: Do things incrementally. Have plan!\nLet’s use the Zybooks Lab.\nRequirements:\n1. I need you to help! Let’s not use ChatGPT (bear with me) just \nGoogle it for now.\n2. I want to download a web page from the internet in Java and \nstore it as a string.\n3. Download and save the images separately in the same \ndirectory as the the string version (yikes!)\n4. Choose a Web page download as a target.  \n6\n--------------------------------------------------\nPage 7 Metadata: {'source': '/Users/tylerderkovitz/downloads/lectureFile/Lecture6.pdf', 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}\n\nDepartment of\nComputer ScienceCSC 213: Large Scale Programming\n“I want to download, programmatically, a Web \npage.”Requirements (continued):\n4. Great - we have a page! \n5. Let’s create a class.  Name it WebPage.java downloader.\n- What is the first thing we need to do to register this as \na class?\n- And to get an entry point?\n6. Great.  Stop here. Compile and run the code.  Do things \nincrementally. Validate expected behavior.\n7\n--------------------------------------------------\nPage 8 Metadata: {'source': '/Users/tylerderkovitz/downloads/lectureFile/Lecture6.pdf', 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}\n\nDepartment of\nComputer ScienceCSC 213: Large Scale Programming\n“I want to download, programmatically, a Web \npage.”Requirements (continued):\n7. So, let’s have it accept 1 argument - the Web page we \nwant.\n- Augment the code so it accepts one argument - the \nURL.\n- We have a choice to make - what is it?  What are the \ntradeoffs between the choices?\n8. Great.  Stop here. Compile and run the code.  Do things \nincrementally. Validate expected behavior.\n8\n--------------------------------------------------\nPage 9 Metadata: {'source': '/Users/tylerderkovitz/downloads/lectureFile/Lecture6.pdf', 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}\n\nDepartment of\nComputer ScienceCSC 213: Large Scale Programming\n“I want to download, programmatically, a Web \npage.”Requirements (continued):\n9. Now, let’s head to Google.  Or, you could read the documentation.  \nRealistically - Google comes first when you are completely new to something.\n- Ask: “how do I connect to a web page in Java”\n10. Well, there’s a great answer! Look at the first one!\n11. Copy and paste the code. \n- What do we have to address immediately.  What do we know is not going to \nwork?\n- What do we do with the errors that might be thrown?\n12. Great.  Stop here. Compile and run the code.  Do things incrementally. \nValidate expected behavior. Purposefully make it break.\n9\n--------------------------------------------------\nPage 10 Metadata: {'source': '/Users/tylerderkovitz/downloads/lectureFile/Lecture6.pdf', 'page': 9, 'page_label': '10'}\n\nDepartment of\nComputer ScienceCSC 213: Large Scale Programming\n“I want to download, programmatically, a Web \npage.”Requirements (continued):\n13. Great.  Now what?  We need get the text from the connection.  So, \nback to Google!\n- You tell me what question to ask!\n14. If we asked the right one - it’s easy.  It’s right there!\n15. Let’s peek around the API at this point after copying and pasting.  We \nmight not understand everything - but maybe at a high level we do!\n12. Great.  Stop here. Compile and run the code.  Do things \nincrementally. Validate expected behavior. Purposefully make it break.\n10\n--------------------------------------------------\nPage 11 Metadata: {'source': '/Users/tylerderkovitz/downloads/lectureFile/Lecture6.pdf', 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}\n\nDepartment of\nComputer ScienceCSC 213: Large Scale Programming\nOne Last Step - You Do This on Your Own or as a \nTeam\n- Now, you want to write that string to a file.  \n- You want to give the file a .html extension (its a web page!)\n- I’ll give you a hint - you build the content and then write it to \na file.\n- Again, you need overcome exceptions.\n- Then, download the file (it will take a bit to happen) and \nopen the page on your local machine!\n- And then think about how to download those images (yikes!)\n11\n--------------------------------------------------\n"
